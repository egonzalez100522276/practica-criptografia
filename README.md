# Spy Agency Web Project

This project is a web application for a fictional spy agency, featuring a React frontend and a Python (FastAPI) backend. It's designed to practice web development and cryptography concepts.

## Quick Start Guide üöÄ

This guide will help you get the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites üìã

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (v3.10 or later recommended)

---

### 1. Backend Setup (Python / FastAPI) üêç

First, let's get the API server running.

#### 1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**

    cd backend

#### 2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

This isolates the project's Python dependencies. Since the `.venv` folder is not in the repository, you need to create it.

    # Create the virtual environment. You might need to use 'python3' on macOS/Linux.
    python -m venv .venv

    # Activate on Windows
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate

    # Activate on macOS/Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate

#### 3. **Install Python dependencies:**

    pip install -r requirements.txt

#### 4. **Make sure the Database is set up**

Run the following command to initialize the database.

        python -m app.db.init_db

> Note: this just creates the tables. If they are already created, YOU CAN STILL RUN THIS SAFELY AND THE EXISTING TABLES WILL BE IGNORED.

#### 5. **Run the backend server:**

uvicorn app.main:app --reload

    The API will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 2. Frontend Setup (React / Vite) ‚öõÔ∏è

With the backend running, open a **new terminal** to set up the frontend.

1.  **Navigate to the project's root directory:**
    (The one containing the `backend` folder and the `package.json` file).

2.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The web application will now be accessible in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.
